    "## Error signals, modulation and demodulation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a Finesse simulation, a cavity will sit perfectly on resonance unless we deliberately alter some parameter that changes the resonant condition of the system. In reality, external disturbances such as seismic noise, temperature changes, or drifts in the input laser frequency will affect the system. The optical system must be actively controlled so that the cavity length and laser frequency are *locked* such that one follows the other, and the cavity stays resonant. \n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we require an error signal that can be used in a feedback loop. \n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, one method to do this is to modulate the input field, producing <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sideband>sidebands</a> which interact with the cavity differently to the main 'carrier' field. The beat signal produced between these sidebands and the carrier, after interacting with the cavity, depends on the resonant condition in the cavity for all of the fields involved.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you have seen, the 'standard' method for locking a laser to a two mirror cavity is the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pound–Drever–Hall_technique>Pound-Drever-Hall (PDH)</a> technique, depicted below. In this case, the input beam is phase modulated to produce a pair of sidebands which do not resonate in the cavity, so are just directly reflected. A photodiode on reflection then measures the beat signal, which is demodulated and low-passed to produce an antisymmetric DC error signal that is linear over the bandwidth of the cavity. This error signal can be fed back to a component that can change the phase of the light, e.g. the laser.\n",

    "**In Finesse** the full PDH technique is replicated using two components: (1) a modulator (`mod`), which can be configured to act like a EOM, EOAM, produce a single sideband, etc; and (2) a demodulating photodiode (`pd[n]`), where `n` specifies the number of demodulations required (1, in our case). The `pd1` combines the roles of the photodiode, mixer, and low-pass filter in a physical setup, directly recording the resulting error signal. \n"
