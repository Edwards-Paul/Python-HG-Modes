    "#### Lengths and tunings\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most crucial aspects in optical interferometery is accurately positioning mirrors. The optical wavelengths we use in gravitational wave detectors is $\\lambda=1064$nm. Typically we are interested in either **macroscopic** positioning, such as a mirror is 1m, 1cm, 1mm, etc. away, or in **microscopic** positions which are fractions of $\\lambda$. The resonance condition of a Fabry-Perot cavity requires its length to be an integer number of half-wavelengths. For the light of an Nd:YAG laser, length differences $\\ll \\lambda=1064$nm are of interest. Some orders of magnitude:\n",
    "  * LIGO peak senitivity in meters: $\\sim 10^{-20}$ m\n",
    "  * LIGO cavity mirror postion control accuracy: $< 10^{-12}$ m\n",
    "  * LIGO arm cavity length: $\\sim 10^3$ m\n",
    "  * Relative numerical accuracy of floating point numbers: $10^{-15}$\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see there are many orders of magnitude difference between the lengths of cavities and the types of signal we might measure. With such a large dynamic range typical floating point variables used in computers cannot represent this. Thus we break lengths up into macroscopic and microscopic lengths. The length given by the `space` component is macroscopic and is always rounded to the nearest interger number of $\\lambda$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We change the microscopic length differences in Finesse by changing a mirror's *tuning* value. Tuning is usually refered to in units of degrees, with 360 degrees $= \\lambda$. So a tuning of 180 degrees means we have moved the mirror by half a wavelength.\n",
