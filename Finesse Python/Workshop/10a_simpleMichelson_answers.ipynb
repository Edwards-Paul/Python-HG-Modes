    "Here is an example of how you would sketch out a simple Michelson, and the fields at various points in the system. Once you have such a sketch, you can use the matrices in Chapter 1 of the LRR article to connect the various fields, and solve for the combinations we are interested in.\n",

    "The first step in the frequency-domain analysis of an optical system is to solve for the *steady-state* fields - that is, the electric field at various points in the system after various transient effects (due to light travel time, or cavity dynamics) have died out. In the LIGO literature, this is often referred to as 'DC analysis'. It's a good idea to keep in mind some of the time-scales involved:\n",

    "It is convenient to perform a basis change from analyzing the Michelson interferometer's individual (X and Y) arms, to their average arm length, $l_+ = \\frac{l_x + l_y}{2},$ and their differential arm length, $l_- = l_x - l_y.$ The phases are then $\\phi_{+(-)} = k l_{+(-)}.$\n",

    "The reflectivity of the Michelson in the notation above is given by $\\frac{\\mathrm{E_{11}}}{\\mathrm{E_{1}}}$, while the transmissivity is given by $\\frac{\\mathrm{E_{10}}}{\\mathrm{E_{1}}}$. We can write out the equations relating the various fields, and get a $\\textbf{system}$ of equations. Solving this set of equations, and assuming that the average arm length, $l_+$ is an integer multiple of the wavelength, yields:\n",
